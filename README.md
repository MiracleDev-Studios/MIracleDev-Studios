**Software Engineer @ UNIOSUN**

## Hey there

I love building things for the web with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Lately, I've been diving into Kotlin as I take my first steps into Android development. I enjoy learning by doing, experimenting, and improving one project at a time.

## What I Use

* **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin (learning)
* **Web Stuff:** Responsive layouts, clean UI, simple animations
* **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code

## What I'm Learning

Right now, I'm figuring out how Android apps work—layouts, components, the whole flow. I'm also polishing my JavaScript skills and improving how I organize my code.

## My Goals

* Build my first full Android app
* Create cleaner, more interactive web experiences
* Work on open-source projects as I grow

## What I'm Working On

Getting better at both web and Android development, one small project at a time.
